### Project Outline and Description

#### **Project Title**: Task Management System

---

### **Project Description:**
This Task Management System is a web-based application built using **Next.js**, with **TypeScript** for type safety, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The system allows users to manage their tasks effectively with features like creating, updating, deleting, and sorting tasks. Additionally, it provides options to mark tasks as starred or completed, and offers a simple user interface to organize tasks based on various criteria like title, status, and date. This project also implements an interactive UI, where users can manage tasks in a dynamic and responsive manner.

### **Features:**

1. **Task CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create**: Users can add new tasks with titles and optional descriptions.
   - **Read**: View all tasks in the system, which can be filtered or sorted.
   - **Update**: Users can edit existing tasks by changing their titles and descriptions.
   - **Delete**: Tasks can be deleted individually or in bulk based on filters (all, completed, or unfinished).

2. **Starred Tasks Management:**
   - Tasks can be marked as "starred" for prioritization.
   - Starred tasks are displayed separately in the **Starred Tasks** page.
   - Starred tasks can be toggled and managed (including deletion and status updates).

3. **Sorting and Filtering:**
   - **Sort Tasks**: Tasks can be sorted by title, status, or date.
   - **Toggle Sort Order**: Users can switch between ascending or descending order for the sorting criteria.
   - **Filter Tasks**: Tasks can be filtered by their completion status (e.g., "completed" or "unfinished").
   - **Delete Filtered Tasks**: Delete tasks based on filter selection (e.g., delete only completed tasks).

4. **Task Status:**
   - Each task can be toggled between "completed" and "unfinished".
   - Tasks can be visually differentiated based on their completion status.

5. **User Interface:**
   - A **navbar** for easy navigation between tasks and starred tasks.
   - A form for creating new tasks.
   - Task cards to display each task with options to edit, delete, mark as completed, or toggle the starred status.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The app is fully responsive, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.
   - Tasks are displayed in a neat and organized manner, using cards with appropriate icons for actions.

7. **API Integration:**
   - The app communicates with a backend API to fetch, create, update, and delete tasks using **Axios**.
   - All task-related actions are reflected instantly with API calls to keep the UI updated.

8. **Task Synchronization:**
   - Tasks are fetched from the backend and updated in real-time, ensuring the frontend displays the latest task state without needing to refresh the page.

### **Technologies Used:**

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building the frontend of the application.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and error checking.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components and layout with utility-first classes.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **React**: For building the UI components and managing application state.
- **React Icons**: For using vector icons in the UI (e.g., for task actions like star, edit, and delete).

### **File Structure:**

- **/src**
  - **/app**
    - **/api**: Contains API calls for CRUD operations on tasks (`tasks.ts`).
    - **/components**: Reusable UI components such as `Navbar.tsx`, `TaskForm.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`.
    - **/pages**: Contains pages for displaying tasks and starred tasks.
    - **layout.tsx**: Layout structure including navigation and global styles.
    - **page.tsx**: Home page displaying the main task list with sorting and filtering options.
    - **starred/page.tsx**: Displays the starred tasks with actions like deletion and status toggling.

### **How to Run the Project:**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install required dependencies using npm or yarn.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Run the project in development mode using:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Use the Application**:
   - Navigate between the **Home** and **Starred Tasks** pages.
   - Create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Mark tasks as completed or starred.
   - Sort and filter tasks based on different criteria.
   - Delete tasks based on their status (completed/unfinished).

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **User Authentication**: Implement user login functionality to allow personal task management.
2. **Task Due Date**: Add a due date for each task and allow filtering by date.
3. **Task Prioritization**: Enable setting priorities for tasks (e.g., low, medium, high).
4. **Notifications**: Add a notification system to remind users of pending tasks or due dates.
5. **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests using tools like **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure the reliability of the system.
6. **Backend Support**: Extend backend functionality with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for persistent task storage.

### **Conclusion:**
This Task Management System is a full-featured web application that efficiently handles task management using modern web development practices. With its simple yet powerful interface, users can easily manage their tasks, keep track of important tasks with starring, and delete tasks in bulk based on their needs. The system also supports sorting and filtering, making it ideal for users who need to stay organized and productive.
